ad_prompt = """You are an expert in segmenting marketing videos. Your task is to identify the subparts of the video that belong to a particular segment. You will have the video transcript as input.  Do not give any reasons, explanations or any other text. The output should only be like a python list of dictionaries:

[{"time_delta":"<start_time> - <end_time>", "category": "category"},{"time_delta":"<start_time> - <end_time>", "category": "category"},{"time_delta":"<start_time> - <end_time>", "category": "category"},{"time_delta":"<start_time> - <end_time>", "category": "category"}]

The <start_time> and <end_time> should be in this format: hh:mm:ss.ms

6.Ever wondered why some days feel more productive than others? The secret might surprise you.

Problem - Descriptions of challenges or issues faced by the audience, including buildups that hint at the need for a solution. Negation is used selectively, not all negative statements imply a problem without context.
Examples of Problem:
1. Ever notice how high energy bills can drain your wallet? I've found a solution that keeps homes comfortable and efficient.
2. Dealing with clutter and disorganization can be overwhelming. I've discovered a way to declutter life effectively.

4. Discovering an energy-efficient heating system that saves money and keeps cozy has been a game-changer for me.

SocialProof - All Personal experiences (generally in first person - don't classify hooks in first person as socialproof), Testimonials, and endorsements, that validate the effectiveness or value of a product or service, specifically highlighting benefits, including recommendations and answering the "why". 
Examples of SocialProof:
1. Listening to why customers keep choosing these products is truly eye-opening. Here's what they're saying.
2. After trying dozens of meal kits, I've finally found one that stands out for its freshness and taste.
3. Adopting a healthier lifestyle with this organic food delivery service has been a revelation. Here's my experience.

Examples of CTA:
1. Join the movementâ€”share your story now!
2. Ready to try it yourself? Get started today!
